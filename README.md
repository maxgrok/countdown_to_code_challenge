# Lecture Countdown 

I volunteered to build a countdown web app to next lecture at the Flatiron School. Here's what I built. 

## To run locally

'git clone' the repo and cd' into your project directory, run 'bundle install', then run 'rails s' 

You should see a site that looks like <a href=""></a>

## Help Developing This

This application was generated with the rails_apps_composer gem:
https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer
provided by the RailsApps Project:
http://railsapps.github.io/

# Reflections 

I came up with some challenges, but they were minimal once I found code that actually worked. I tried the 'countdown' gem and the 'js-countdown-rails' gem. Neither of them worked terribly well. So, I ended up going with a simple jQuery plugin that can be found here:<a href="https://github.com/hilios/jQuery.countdown">jQuery Countdown</a>.

I also needed to remove the remote git that pointed to the rails-app-composer git repo and replace it with my own git remote repo that I made, but the challenges were minimal.
